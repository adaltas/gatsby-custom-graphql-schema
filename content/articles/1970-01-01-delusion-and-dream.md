An isolated, unworldly individual, Hanold has repressed the memory of a girl, ZoÃ« Bertgang, with whom he has grown up and to whom he had been affectionately attached; but is unconsciously reminded of her by a bas-relief depicting a young, lovely woman with a distinctive gait. He calls her "Gradiva," which means "the woman who steps along".
